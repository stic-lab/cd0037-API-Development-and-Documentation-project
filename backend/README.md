# Backend - Trivia API

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createbd trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Run the Server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Yous should create `.env` file which should contain database configuration. See below for an example that should be putted in the `.env` file.

````bash
DATABASE_NAME='database_name'
DATABASE_NAME_TEST='database_test_name'
DATABASE_USER='user'
DATABASE_PASSWORD='password'
````
To run the server, execute one by one these command below:
#### On linux or mac
```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
#### On Windows
```bash
set FLASK_APP=flaskr
set FLASK_ENV=development
$env:FLASK_APP="flaskr"
flask run
```

## API Documentation

- This section will describe how to use each endpoints endpoints. In the last section, you will find how to test those endpoints.
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as proxi in the fronted configuration.
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```json
{
  "success": False, 
  "error": 404, 
  "message": "resource not found"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Ressource Not Found
- 422: Not Processible
- 405: "Method Not Allowed
